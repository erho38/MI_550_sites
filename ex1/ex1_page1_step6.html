                <p>Chinchillas are small, crepuscular rodents that are native to the Andes Mountains in South America. There are two species of chinchilla, the <i>Chinchilla chinchilla</i> and the <i>Chinchilla lanigera.</i> They have extremely dense fur, round ears, and bushy tails. They are very commonly hunted for their luxurious fur, but are also commonly kept as pets.</p>
