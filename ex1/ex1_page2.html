                <p>The horse is a four legged, one-toed, hoofed mammal. Humans began domesticating horses around the time of 4000 BCE, and while there are some domesticated horse populations that live in the wild, they are not true wild horses, as they are considered feral horses. Horses have a very strong <b>fight or flight</b> response, which has allowed them to adapt to running fast, and also allows them to sleep standing up, as this allows them to flee quicker in the case of danger.</p>
                <h2>Horse colors</h2>
                <p>There are two basic pigment colors of horses, <i>pheomelanin</i> which gives them a reddish brown, or commonly referred to as chestnut, color. The second is <i>eumelanin</i> which gives them a fully black color. Other coat colors are a result of additional genes that modify these two base colors, which results in variations in those two coat colors. Horses with white or cream in their coats have the gene that gives them that color. Grey horses can be born with a different coat color, and the grey/white develops over time, as it ages. This <a href="https://mynewhorse.equusmagazine.com/2023/07/28/a-comprehensive-guide-to-common-horse-coat-colors/" target="_blank">website</a> has some <b>cool</b> photos of all the different horse colors.</p>
