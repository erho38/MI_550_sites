                <h1>Chinchillas</h1>
                <p>Chinchillas are small, crepuscular rodents that are native to the Andes Mountains in South America. There are two species of chinchilla, the <i>Chinchilla chinchilla</i> and the <i>Chinchilla lanigera.</i> They have extremely dense fur, round ears, and bushy tails. They are very commonly hunted for their luxurious fur, but are also commonly kept as pets.

                <p>Chinchillas come in a number of colors, the most common are various shades of grey or black, but are often white or a sort of tanish beige color. Chinchillas can also be <b>multicolored</b>, where their bellies or tails are a different color or shade from the rest of their bodies. Below is the screencast of why I chose this detail of the photo.</p>
